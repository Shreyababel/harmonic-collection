    <h1>Exploring Hidden Bookstores in NYC</h1>
    <p>When it feels like there's no time to spare, somehow we always manage to make time to browse through the shelves of a local bookstore. New York City is packed with options, from tiny neighborhood spots that are easy to miss to huge, iconic bookstores. You’ll find a huge range of authors and topics, catering to all sorts of tastes and interests. But specialty bookstores are a different kind of magic. They’re completely dedicated to one topic, which makes them super fascinating. Whether you’re searching for your niche or just want to explore something new, check out these awesome specialty bookstores in NYC!</p>
    <h3>For Broadway and/or Lin-Manuel Miranda fans</h3>
    <h4>Drama Book Shop</h4>
    <p>Drama Book Shop is such a classic NYC spot. It’s been around since 1917, and became its own indie bookstore in 1923. Over the last century, it’s become the go-to place in the city for anything theater-related. It’s so important to the theater world that in 2011, it even won a Tony Award for Excellence in the Theater.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the store got flooded after a pipe burst, and Lin-Manuel Miranda (yes, the guy behind Hamilton) asked his fans to help out by using the hashtag #BuyABook. Fast forward to 2018, the shop was about to close due to rent hikes, and Lin-Manuel, along with some Hamilton alums, stepped in to save it. Now, Drama Book Shop is still thriving and has over 8,000 plays, plus biographies, sheet music, and other theater-related stuff. So if you’re ever in the area, definitely carve out some time to explore!</p>

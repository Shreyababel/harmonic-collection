      <div class="rightdetails">
        <h3>Manhattan</h3>
        <p>The Bowery Wall, with roots tracing back to Keith Haring, remains an iconic canvas for both established and emerging artists. Its rich history highlights the work of some of the world’s most renowned street artists. However, the wall hasn’t been without controversy. From the contentious decision to commission an artist accused of sexual assault to murals addressing intense themes like gun violence, the Bowery Wall has seen its share of dramatic and thought-provoking moments.</p>

    <h4>First Street Green Art Park</h4>
    <p>More than a decade after First Park's renovation and reopening, one section with an abandoned building still stood as an eyesore. In 2008, community members came together to form First Street Green to address the issue. They started by creating a garden and later added a paved plaza. Jonathan Neville, an artist and community activist, proposed a mural project to First Street Green, which became such a success that they decided to continue it.</p>

    <div >
    <h4>The LISA Project</h4>
    <p>The LISA (Little Italy Street Art) Project has been curating street art in NYC for more than a decade, though their name might be a bit misleading. Their murals stretch beyond Little Italy, reaching the Lower East Side, SoHo, and the East Village. They’re responsible for some of the city's most iconic pieces, including Shepard Fairey’s Blondie mural on Bleecker Street, which was later replaced in 2022 by Fairey’s tribute to the punk band Bad Brains, and Tristan Eaton’s famous Audrey Hepburn mural in Little Italy.</p>

    <h4>East Village Walls</h4>
    <p>East Village Walls began as a grassroots effort focused on beautifying the neighborhood. Founder and local photographer Ben, a resident of the Lower East Side, often spoke with business owners frustrated by graffiti vandalism. Using his connections within the close-knit street art community and outreach through Instagram, he built the organization. Now, artists from near and far pitch their ideas, and Ben carefully curates the walls, selecting art that complements the neighborhood’s vibe. The murals rotate every 3-4 months, keeping the area fresh and visually dynamic.</p>

    <div>
    <h4>The New Allen</h4>
    <p> The New Allen shows that street art has fans from all walks of life. It was created by Franco Noriega and Milan Kelez, the restaurateurs behind the Peruvian spot Baby Brasa. Kelez, a painter himself, has closely followed the evolution of street art, believing, like his idol Banksy, that art can spark important conversations. Together, Kelez and Noriega launched The New Allen as a passion project, aiming to uplift neighborhoods while offering artists a space to showcase diverse perspectives.</p>

    <h4>Freeman Alley</h4>
    <p> Freemans, a Lower East Side eatery, is often credited with kickstarting the gentrification of the once gritty Bowery. In its early days, though, the alley leading to the restaurant held onto its raw edge. A haven for sprayers and pasters, you never knew what you’d stumble upon. That began to change when the boutique hotel Untitled At 3 Freemans Alley moved in. Embracing the alley’s street art vibe, the hotel used local talent to shape its modern, creative identity, signaling the neighborhood's full transformation.</p>

    <h4>The Highline</h4>
    <p> With support from both public and private funds, High Line Art commissions works from a diverse range of local, national, and international artists. The variety is truly impressive, and it changes often enough to make return visits worthwhile. It's still one of our favorite NYC experiences, even for locals! Amidst the multimedia pieces and sculptures, you'll always find a mural at the 22nd Street space, like the playful *NYC LOVE* by Nina Chanel Abney.</p>

    <h4>The Museum of Street Art (MoSA)</h4>
    <p> The Museum of Street Art at CitizenM Bowery Hotel is a tribute to the legacy of 5Pointz, the once vibrant Long Island City, Queens mural space housed in a former factory. Although you’ll see many references to the legendary outdoor graffiti space in several of the street art galleries named here, this is the only one that has verifiable, tangible ties to it. Besides a show-stopping entrance, the museum spans the stairwells of 20 floors and features numerous high-profile artists who were contributors at 5Pointz. </p>
